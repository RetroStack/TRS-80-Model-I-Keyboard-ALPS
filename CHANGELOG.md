## Versioning

I've devised a versioning system for my replica projects. This system provides clarity about each of my version's significance. My version identifier consistently follows the original revision details, allowing for a clear distinction between the original manufacturer's revision and my own.

Here's the format for the versioning:
- The initial character is always an "E," representing my last name. This choice ensures that others can adopt the same versioning style if needed.
- The following character is a number, with "1" signifying a 1-1 re-implementation of the original. Numbers beyond "1" denote various board variations, such as new designs features, more modern components, or different interface ports.
- The final character represents my actual revision of that board. Using a character for this purpose distinguishes it from the re-implementation type mentioned above, and it allows for up to 26 revisions to refine the project.
