# TRS-80 Model 1 - ALPS Keyboard Replica PCB

This project is a faithful reimplementation of the ALPS keyboard PCB of the iconic TRS-80 Model 1 computer. My revision, the E1, is designed to replicate the PCB design 1-to-1 of the original down to the traces. The entire project is available under the MIT license.

### Latest Files

In the "Latest" folder, you'll find the most up-to-date design files, including:

- Gerber files suitable for popular online PCB manufacturers like [PCBWay](/Latest/TRS80_Model_I_Keyboard_ALPS_E1_Gerber_PCBWay.zip) and [JLCPCB](/Latest/TRS80_Model_I_Keyboard_ALPS_E1_Gerber_JLCPCB.zip). Most manufacturers should be fine with either.
- A Bill of Materials (BOM) in [PDF](/Latest/TRS80_Model_I_Keyboard_ALPS_E1_BOM.pdf) format.
- The [full schematics](/Latest/TRS80_Model_I_Keyboard_ALPS_E1_Schematics.pdf) of the E1 replica which is 1:1 to the original G board.

### Implementation
